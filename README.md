> This is a project that I created during my Programming 2 classes which became my final assignment on the 2¬∞ grade of my high school.

## üíª Requirements

Before testing it, make sure that you follow the requirements below:

- You installed the latest version of `C#`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Caution
1. Before testing my code, you should know that the connection with the `Microsoft SQL Server` database is a mess and it will not work.
2. Because of the last error, some elements like listView or some button functions will not work.
